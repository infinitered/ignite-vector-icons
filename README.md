# ignite-vector-icons

## Why is this archived?

We really appreciate all the community support in the years since we first released ignite-vector-icons. Our focus has shifted to the latest version of [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite), which does not have a plugin-based architecture ([read more here](https://shift.infinite.red/introducing-ignite-4-0-flame-1dfc891f9966)). Feel free to fork this library and continue on its legacy if you want. 

An [ignite plugin](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) for [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons).

## Premium Support

[Ignite](https://infinite.red/ignite) and [ignite-vector-icons](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-vector-icons), as open source projects, are free to use and always will be.
